# Unreleased

**Time-grid view (Google Calendar–style)** addressing [#300](https://github.com/alexpfau/calendar-card-pro/issues/300). Opt in via `view: time-grid`; the existing list view is byte-identical and remains the default.

## 🎉 New Features

### 🕒 Time-Grid View

A 2-D calendar view: vertical = time of day, horizontal = days. Multi-day all-day events render as horizontal banners at the top, with `◂` / `▸` indicators for events that extend beyond the visible window. A live "now" line on today's column updates every minute and migrates to the new day-column at midnight rollover.

- **Responsive columns**: 1 / 3 / 7 days based on the card's rendered width via `ResizeObserver`. Breakpoints are configurable (`time_grid_breakpoint_three_day_px`, `time_grid_breakpoint_seven_day_px`).
- **Week alignment**: at 7-day width the window snaps to the configured first day of the week (Mon by default, Sun per `first_day_of_week`). At 1- and 3-day width the window is rolling.
- **Navigation**: `«` `‹` `Today` `›` `»` buttons let users scroll forward/backward within `time_grid_navigation_days` (default 28). The `‹` / `›` single-step buttons are hidden in 7-day mode (window snaps to weeks).
- **Decoupled fetch range**: `time_grid_navigation_days` is independent of `days_to_show` (which still drives list view). Toggling `view` triggers a refetch via the now view-aware `hasConfigChanged`.
- **Visual editor support**: the new "Time grid" expansion panel exposes all `time_grid_*` knobs; the list-only sections (Compact Mode, `days_to_show`, `show_empty_days`) hide when grid view is active. `show_past_events`, `filter_duplicates` apply to both views.
- **Accessibility**: nav buttons have `aria-label` strings (with `{n}` substitution for the window-shift labels) and `aria-disabled='true'`/`'false'` at edges.
- **Performance**: the now-line position is updated by direct `style.top` mutation (no full re-render); the interval pauses when the tab is hidden.
- **Card-mod / theme**: three new CSS custom properties — `--calendar-card-grid-time-axis-width` (default `48px`), `--calendar-card-grid-event-radius` (default `4px`), `--calendar-card-grid-allday-max-height` (default `6em`).

11 new flat scalar config fields (`view`, `time_grid_start_hour`, `time_grid_end_hour`, `time_grid_interval_minutes`, `time_grid_event_min_height_px`, `time_grid_show_now_line`, `time_grid_max_days`, `time_grid_breakpoint_three_day_px`, `time_grid_breakpoint_seven_day_px`, `time_grid_navigation_days`, `time_grid_allday_bg_opacity`); see README.md section 6 for the full table. All have safe defaults; `setConfig` validates and coerces invalid values to defaults with a console warning.

### 🛠️ Other improvements

- New pure-helper module `src/utils/grid.ts` with 92 unit tests (Vitest) covering date math, event placement, overlap layout, banner placement, now-line position, today-offset, card size, and DST safety. The test framework is new to this repo; pure helpers in future work should follow the same pattern.

## 🔧 Compatibility

- **List view byte-identical**: `src/rendering/render.ts` is unchanged from v3.2.0. `src/utils/events.ts` adds exactly one optional argument (`effectiveDaysToShow?: number`) to `fetchEventData`; existing callers pass nothing → behavior unchanged.
- **No breaking changes**: all new fields are optional with safe defaults. Existing configs continue to work without modification.
- **HA versions**: same as v3.2.0 (HA 2026.3+).

## 📈 Bundle size

`dist/calendar-card-pro.js` grows from 288,879 bytes (v3.2.0) to ~313 KB — well under the +20 KB design budget when accounting for the renderer, helpers, and CSS.

## 🌍 Translations

English (`en.json`) covers all new editor labels, navigation aria strings, and the "Today" button label. Other 32 languages fall back to English automatically; per-language translations land as follow-up PRs.

- **`uv_index_threshold` Option** - Only display the UV index when it exceeds a configurable threshold value (e.g., set to 3 to hide low UV readings)

### 🎨 Enhanced Customization

- **Event Icon Vertical Alignment** - New `event_icon_vertical_alignment` option (`top`, `middle`, `bottom`) to control vertical positioning of time, location, and description icons relative to their text
- **Label Icon Color** - New per-entity `label_icon_color` option to customize the color of `mdi:` and other icon-type labels independently from event text color, with full visual editor support (Thanks @aw1604, #302)
- **Two-Digit Hours** - New `time_two_digit_hours` option to pad single-digit hours with a leading zero (e.g., `09:00` instead of `9:00`)

### 🔄 Improved Loading UX

- Events now remain visible during background data refresh instead of being replaced by a loading spinner
- A subtle, non-intrusive spinner appears in the top-right corner during refresh
- Added `aria-busy` attribute on the card for improved accessibility
- Distinguished initial load (full spinner) from background refresh (subtle indicator)

### ↔️ RTL Language Support

- **Browser_mod Compatibility** - Delegated tap/hold actions to Home Assistant's native action handler, restoring compatibility with browser_mod and similar custom integrations

### Weather & Performance

- **Weather WebSocket Subscription Leak** - Fixed a memory leak caused by weather forecast WebSocket subscriptions accumulating over time without proper cleanup (#291)
- **Enhanced Refreshing and Caching Logic** - Improved data refresh reliability with better cache invalidation and smarter refresh triggers (#297)

### Location & Description Processing

- **Location Display Corruption Fix** - Removed redundant location/description processing in the renderer that could corrupt location strings when using a custom `remove_location_country` regex pattern—e.g., a regex like `New York|USA` could inadvertently blank the location after double-processing (Thanks @sevorl, #331)

### Visual Editor

- **Date Picker Fix** - Replaced the broken date picker component with a native date input for reliable start date selection
- **Start Date Offset Field** - Fixed the start_date relative offset field (`today+N`) vanishing during editing
- **Label Icon Color Editor** - Added `label_icon_color` to the visual editor entity configuration panels

# Calendar Card Pro v3.1.0

**Enhanced internationalization and improved customization.** This release significantly expands language support for the visual configuration editor while adding powerful new customization options and fixing important display issues.

## 🎉 New Features

### 🌐 Expanded Editor Language Support

Calendar Card Pro's visual configuration editor now supports three additional languages, making configuration accessible to even more users:

- **Norwegian Bokmål Editor Translation** - Complete translation for the visual configuration editor interface (Thanks @mathiasbk, #235)
- **German Editor Translation** - Complete translation for the visual configuration editor interface (Thanks @NetSecond, #237)
- **Swedish Editor Translation** - Complete translation for the visual configuration editor interface (Thanks @JonasHedberg, #238)

The visual editor now supports 5 languages total: English, Slovak, Norwegian, German, and Swedish.

### 🆕 New Language Addition

- **Bulgarian Language Support** - Added complete Bulgarian translation for the calendar card interface, bringing the total number of supported languages to **30**! (Thanks @kyutov, #246)

### 🎨 Enhanced Styling Capabilities

- **Tomorrow CSS Class** - Added new HTML `tomorrow` CSS class to tomorrow's events, enabling users to use card-mod to apply specific styling to tomorrow's events that's distinct from other future events. See the ReadMe for an example. (Thanks @Squazel, #249)

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Weather Display Improvements

- **Zero Temperature Display Fix** - Fixed an issue where minimum temperature values of exactly 0° would not be displayed in the date column when `show_low_temp: true` was configured. The condition now properly handles zero values by checking for `undefined` instead of using truthy evaluation. (Thanks @DaveOzzie, #252)

### Layout and Container Issues

- **Grid Container Overflow Fix** - Resolved an issue where the calendar card would exceed its container boundaries and overlay other sections when `grid_options.rows` was configured. The card now properly respects container boundaries in all grid configurations. (Thanks @Deltids, #233)

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Event Background Color Fix** - Fixed an issue where the event background color did not correctly use the global `accent_color` setting when no entity-specific `accent_color` was defined. The event background now properly matches the global accent color setting.
- **Slovak Translation Typo Fix** - Fixed a small typo in the Slovak translation for the calendar card interface. (Thanks @jose1711, #230)

# Calendar Card Pro v3.0.5

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Allowlist/Blocklist Filtering Fix** - Fixed incorrect behavior when using multiple configurations for the same calendar entity with different allowlist/blocklist filters. Each entity configuration is now processed independently, correctly applying filters and event limits.
- **Empty Space Removal** - Resolved an issue causing excessive empty space when `compact_events_to_show` was set only at the entity level without a global limit. Days without visible events are now properly filtered out, eliminating unnecessary empty space.
- **Ukrainian Translation Fix** - Corrected incorrect Ukrainian translations for calendar elements.

# Calendar Card Pro v2.4.5

**Consistent calendar display in all scenarios.** This release fixes an important bug affecting the display of empty days when an API call returns no events.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Completely Consistent Empty Days Display

- **Unified Empty Days Logic** - Removed separate rendering paths for different empty day scenarios, ensuring consistent behavior in all cases
- **Fixed Show Empty Days Setting** - Corrected the handling of `show_empty_days: true` when the calendar API returns zero events

## 📖 Documentation Improvements

### New Card-Mod Examples

- **Time Next to Event Title** - Added documentation for displaying time in the same row as event titles using card-mod, keeping location on its own row below:

```yaml
card_mod:
  style: |
    div.event-content {
      display: grid;
      grid-template-areas: 
        "title time"
        "location location";
      grid-template-columns: 1fr auto;
      column-gap: 10px;
      row-gap: 0px;
    }

    div.summary {
      grid-area: title;
      overflow: hidden;
      text-overflow: ellipsis;
    }

    div.time {
      grid-area: time;
      white-space: nowrap;
    }

    div.location {
      grid-area: location;
      white-space: normal;
      overflow: hidden;
      text-overflow: ellipsis;
    }

    div.time-location {
      display: contents;
    }
```

# Calendar Card Pro v2.4.4

**More consistent empty days behavior.** This release fixes an important bug affecting the display of empty days, ensuring the calendar shows exactly what you expect in all configurations.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Improved Empty Days Display

- **Fixed Empty Days Behavior** - Resolved an issue where empty days weren't consistently displayed when `show_empty_days: true` was configured, particularly at the end of the date range
- **Proper Mode Handling** - Fixed how empty days interact with compact mode settings, correctly handling both `compact_days_to_show` and `compact_events_to_show` parameters
- **Edge Case Support** - Better handling of date ranges with sparse events, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of event distribution
- **Parameter Validation** - Ensures `compact_days_to_show` never exceeds `days_to_show` to prevent showing empty days beyond the API fetch range

## Related Issues

This release addresses a community-reported issue:

- [#189](https://github.com/alexpfau/calendar-card-pro/issues/189) - Fixed bug where empty days weren't shown at the end of the date range when `show_empty_days: true` was configured

## How Has This Been Tested

Testing has been conducted across:

- Multiple calendar configurations with various `days_to_show` ranges
- Scenarios with events in different distribution patterns (beginning, middle, or end of range)

# Calendar Card Pro v2.4.3

**Bug fixes for edge cases.** This release addresses several critical edge case bugs around the display of week separators and empty days, ensuring the calendar always behaves predictably in all configurations.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Fixed Week Separator Display

- **Week/Month Separator Precedence** - Corrected a bug where week separators weren't displaying when month boundaries coincided with week boundaries and the `month_separator_width` was set to '0px'
- **Proper Visual Hierarchy** - Week separators now appear correctly when they should take precedence over invisible month separators

### Improved Empty Days Handling

- **Fixed Days_to_Show Behavior** - Resolved an issue where the calendar would incorrectly skip empty days and show events from future days instead of properly displaying "No events" messages
- **Consistent Empty State Display** - Empty state message now consistently shows when there are no events within the configured time range

## Related Issues

This release addresses community-reported issues:

- [#160](https://github.com/alexpfau/calendar-card-pro/issues/160) - Fixed bug where the calendar would show future days' events instead of properly respecting the `days_to_show` parameter
- [#175](https://github.com/alexpfau/calendar-card-pro/issues/175) - Fixed week separators not showing when they coincide with month boundaries

## How Has This Been Tested

Testing has been conducted across:

- Multiple calendar configurations with various `days_to_show` and `start_date` settings
- Scenarios with only past events today but events tomorrow
- Calendars with month/week boundaries falling on the same day
- Various combinations of separator width settings

# Calendar Card Pro v2.4.1

**Edge case handling and visual refinement.** This update addresses two specific user-reported issues to ensure your calendar card displays correctly in all scenarios.

→→→ All bug fixes are fully compatible with existing configurations, requiring no changes to your cards. ←←←

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Fixed Empty Day Display Issue

Resolved a bug where days with no events were being skipped if:

- The following day contained at least one event

Now the calendar correctly shows "No upcoming events" for the configured start date, rather than skipping ahead to the next day with events.

### Improved Scrollbar Behavior

Enhanced the scrollbar handling to:

- Show vertical scrollbars only when hovering and content exceeds the container height
- Never show horizontal scrollbars regardless of content width
- Maintain consistent behavior across all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Related Issues

This release addresses the following user-reported issues:

## 🎉 New Features

### Advanced Event Filtering

```yaml
# Exclude specific events by pattern:
entities:
  - entity: calendar.work
    blocklist: "Private|Conference" # Hide private meetings and conferences

# Only show specific events:
entities:
  - entity: calendar.family
    allowlist: "Birthday|Anniversary" # Only show birthdays and anniversaries
```

- **Regular Expression Support** - Use pattern matching for flexible event filtering
- **Precise Control** - Include or exclude events based on title text patterns
- **Priority System** - When both filters are specified, allowlist takes precedence

### Filter Duplicate Events

Automatically detect and remove redundant events that appear in multiple calendars:

```yaml
entities:
  - calendar.personal # Events from this calendar are prioritized
  - calendar.family # Duplicates from this calendar will be hidden
filter_duplicates: true
```

- **Smart Prioritization** - When duplicates are found, keeps events from calendars listed first
- **Complete Matching** - Compares event title, times, and location for accurate detection
- **Better Organization** - Creates a cleaner view when subscribing to multiple calendars with overlapping events

    label: '💻' # Original emoji style
  - entity: calendar.family
    label: 'mdi:account-group' # Material Design Icon
  - entity: calendar.vacation
    label: '/local/icons/beach.png' # Custom image

```yaml
# Option 1: Specify exactly which countries to remove
remove_location_country: "USA|United States|Canada"

# Option 2: Use built-in country detection (previous behavior)
remove_location_country: true

# Option 3: Keep all country information (new default)
remove_location_country: false
```

- **Extended Parameter** - Now accepts custom country name patterns in addition to boolean values
- **Backward Compatible** - Still supports the previous `true`/`false` options
- **Regular Expression Support** - Match multiple country variations with one pattern
- **Enhanced Flexibility** - Keep international locations intact while simplifying domestic addresses
- **⚠ Default Changed** - Now defaults to `false` for more predictable global behavior

- **Theme Integration** - Works with Home Assistant theme variables
- **Enhanced Accessibility** - Better control over contrast ratios
